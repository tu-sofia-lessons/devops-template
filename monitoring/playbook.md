# Monitoring Playbook
- KPIs: build success rate (docs completion), lead time for changes, MTTR (mean time to restore docs)
- Dashboards: outline what you would track (sections completed, review status)
- Alerts: thresholds/channels for communication

# Monitoring Playbook

## Purpose
This playbook defines how we measure and monitor key performance indicators (KPIs) and service level indicators (SLIs) across our DevOps workflow.  
It ensures early detection of issues, consistent visibility into delivery performance, and alignment with our release objectives.

---

## Objectives
- Detect stalled or failing processes (e.g., unreviewed PRs, failed merges).
- Track delivery performance metrics (lead time, review rate, deployment success).
- Provide actionable alerts and dashboards for each team.
- Support continuous improvement of our release cycle.

## Monitoring Scope
| Area | Description | Owner |
|------|--------------|-------|
| Pull Requests | Review rate, activity, and merge time | Development Team |
| CI/CD Pipelines | Build/test/merge success rates | DevOps Team |
| Release Flow | Develop â†’ Main merge health | Release Team |
| Infrastructure | GitHub Actions performance & automation | Operations Team |

---

## KPIs and SLIs
| KPI | Description | Target | SLO |
|-----|--------------|--------|-----|
| Lead Time for Changes | Average time from commit to merge | â‰¤ 1 day | 90% within 24h |
| Review Completion Rate | % of PRs reviewed within 24h | â‰¥ 90% | 95% per sprint |
| Conflict Resolution Time | Avg. time to resolve merge conflicts | â‰¤ 30 min | 85% resolved on time |
| Deployment Success Rate | % of successful merges to main | â‰¥ 98% | 99% success rate |

All metrics are defined and tracked in [`metrics.yaml`](./metrics.yaml).

---

## Tools and Data Sources
- **GitHub Insights** â€” PR activity, review rates, merge durations.  
- **GitHub Actions** â€” CI/CD pipeline success, workflow duration.  
- **Prometheus Exporters** â€” Collect metrics from pipelines and GitHub APIs.  
- **Grafana** â€” Visualize all metrics in the DevOps dashboard.

---

## Alerting Guidelines
| Severity | Condition | Action | Channel |
|-----------|------------|--------|----------|
| ðŸ”´ Critical | CI/CD pipeline fails or merge to main blocked | Notify on-call engineer immediately | `#on-call-sre` |
| ðŸŸ  Warning | PR inactive > 24h | Ping PR owner and reviewer | `#team-chat` |
| ðŸŸ¡ Info | Upcoming release pending approval | Notify release coordinator | `#devops-dashboard` |

All alert definitions are maintained in [`metrics.yaml`](./metrics.yaml).

---

## Escalation Workflow
1. **Alert Triggered** â†’ Logged in monitoring dashboard.  
2. **First Response** â†’ Assigned on-call engineer investigates root cause.  
3. **If unresolved in 15 minutes** â†’ Escalate to **Incident Response Team**.  
4. **Postmortem** â†’ Document in [`runbooks/postmortem-template.md`](../runbooks/postmortem-template.md).

---

## Review and Continuous Improvement
- All KPIs and thresholds are reviewed **each release cycle (v1.x)**.  
- New metrics are proposed via Pull Request to `monitoring/metrics.yaml`.  
- Teams validate alertsâ€™ effectiveness during retrospectives.  
- Metrics and dashboards are versioned alongside releases for traceability.
